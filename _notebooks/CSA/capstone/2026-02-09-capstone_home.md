<h2> Design-Based Research (DBR) Capstone Projects </h2>

These capstone projects follow the **DBR methodology**: iterative cycles of design, implementation, and analysis to solve complex, real-world problems. Each project produces both an effective intervention and reusable design principles.

 <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
  <li><strong>Technical Requirements:</strong> ML, database work, and one or more advanced data structures (e.g., graph).</li>
  <li><strong>Languages:</strong> JavaScript, Java preferred. Python on approval.</li>
  <li><strong>DBR Cycles:</strong> 2-4+ iterations refining prototypes based on user feedback and data.</li>
  <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> All projects must be deployed and linked below.</li>
 </ul>

<h2> Project Briefs </h2>

<h2> DBR Framework </h2>

Each project brief should address the following DBR components:

<div class="my-4">
 <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
  <li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> What real-world problem are you solving?</li>
  <li><strong>Design/Intervention:</strong> What is your proposed solution?</li>
  <li><strong>Iteration Cycles:</strong> How will you test, evaluate, and refine?</li>
  <li><strong>Technical Stack:</strong> ML model, database, data structures, deployment.</li>
  <li><strong>Impact:</strong> What outcomes and design principles will you produce?</li>
 </ul>
</div>
