# Database Defenders Capstone Infographic
Title: "Database Defenders Capstone"
Description: "A Design-Based Research capstone building a multi-layer automated data loss prevention system for Flask/Aurora — protecting against data corruption, enabling fast recovery, and helping operators make confident decisions under pressure."

    subtitle: "Preventing Data Loss Before It Happens"
    description: "A multi-layer protection system built on top of Flask and Amazon Aurora to prevent, detect, and recover from data loss incidents. Parses Docker logs in real-time using LLM-based analysis to catch mass password resets, bulk user changes, and suspicious migration executions before they cause harm. Automated Aurora snapshots run on configurable schedules with defined RPO/RTO targets. A static GitHub Pages frontend lets operators trigger on-demand backups, approve migrations, and monitor system health — all without increasing cognitive load or introducing new failure modes."

      - "AWS IAM & S3"
    impact:
      - "Zero data loss incidents after full deployment"
      - "< 15 min detection time for anomalous DB operations"
      - "100% migration success rate with snapshot-backed rollback"
      - "Reduces operator cognitive load through structured dashboards"
      - "Teaches operators to trust, supervise, and intervene safely"

    alt: "Database Defenders - Spring Security Hardening"
    keyPoints:
      - "Unified JWT + session auth with consistent logout"
      - "ROLE_ prefix normalization across all Spring controllers"
      - "Secrets moved out of application.properties to CI env"
      - "Secure password reset with expiring single-use tokens"
      - "Least-privilege API surface with explicit role policies"
      - "S3 presigned URLs and IAM access controls"
    subtitle: "Hardening the Spring Split-Brain Auth System"
    description: "A focused security hardening plan targeting the Spring backend's split-brain auth drift, over-permissive MVC endpoints, and embedded secrets. Unifies JWT cookie and session logout, normalizes all roles to ROLE_ prefix, restricts permitAll routes to a minimal whitelist, replaces the in-memory password reset system with signed short-lived tokens, and moves all credentials to environment secrets. Complementary to the database protection layer — together they form a full-stack security posture."

      - "Thymeleaf Templates"
      - "PostgreSQL Audit Logs"
      - "AWS S3 Presigned URLs"
      - "GitHub Secrets / .env"
    impact:
      - "Zero unauthorized access incidents after rollout"
      - "All roles ROLE_-prefixed in Spring views and controllers"
      - "Logout clears both JWT and session on local and prod"
      - "All secrets removed from application.properties"
      - "100% sensitive endpoints mapped to explicit role policy"
