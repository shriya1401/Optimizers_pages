      - "Auto-reconnect for reliable network handling"
    subtitle: "Local-First Monitoring Without Cloud Dependencies"
    description: "Granolaa is a local monitoring application that streams live screen and webcam feeds over local HTTP URLs, viewable in any browser without cloud infrastructure, accounts, or external services. Through iterative Research Through Design cycles with educators, the system evolved from a monolithic prototype into a scalable production system. Initial user interviews identified needs for multi-device support, low-barrier entry, real-time monitoring, and privacy controls. Architecture was redesigned to separate client capture, server streaming, and browser frontend—improving performance by 60% and enabling 25+ concurrent streams. Performance optimization cycles adopted 30fps with dynamic quality adjustment, balancing bandwidth constraints with classroom usability. Webcam integration was added for hybrid scenarios."
