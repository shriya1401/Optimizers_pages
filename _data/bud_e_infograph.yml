    subtitle: "Gamifying Focus With a Growing Virtual Companion"
    description: "Bud-E is a browser extension that gamifies productivity through a persistent virtual pet. Students configure whitelisted productive websites (documentation, educational platforms, coding environments) and the pet grows in real-time while they stay focused. Clicking away to distracting sites causes the pet to degrade visually. Unlike punitive blockers, Bud-E provides positive reinforcement through an emotionally-engaging character. Design research revealed that character growth resonates more than blocking/restriction. The system progresses through distinct visual stages, creating satisfying visual feedback for sustained focus while maintaining low anxiety."
