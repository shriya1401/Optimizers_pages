    subtitle: "Making Issue Tracking Feel Like a Teammate, Not a Chore"
    description: "A system that transforms GitHub issue management from a tedious overhead task into an intelligent, student-friendly workflow. A Chrome extension watches what files students are touching and proactively suggests issue tracking in context. When students hit Generate, Claude builds a fully-formatted issue — user story, DBR design rationale, acceptance criteria, and labels — based on what they actually built. A soft skills scorer privately evaluates issue clarity and design-first thinking before posting, offering nudges rather than grades. Issue-to-commit alignment maps what issues claim against what diffs show, surfacing drift before standups. Teachers access everything through a single /pulse Slack command that delivers a 30-second evoke transcription of every team's last activity, issue health, and alignment score."
